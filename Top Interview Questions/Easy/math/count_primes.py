# Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.


# Example 1:

# Input: n = 10
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 0
# Output: 0
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 1
# Output: 0


# Constraints:

# 0 <= n <= 5 * 106
